# badMIXTUREexample: checking a mixture decomposition from PLINK data

This example runs through the process of:
0. Getting the data
1. Converting plink data to mixPainter (chromopainter) format
2. Running ADMIXTURE
3. Running mixPainter in a way that allows comparisons to the ADMIXTURE run
4. Getting the data out of mixPainter and into the badMIXTURE R package.

# Step 0: Getting the data

From a linux or mac terminal, copy the example data from our repository:

```
## Get the data
 
## For linux:
alias mywget=wget
## For mac OSX:
if [ `uname` == "Darwin" ]; then
   alias mywget="curl -O"
fi
files="Recent_admix.bim Marginalisation_admix.bim Remnants_admix.bim Remnants_admix.fam Recent_admix.fam Marginalisation_admix.fam Marginalisation_admix.bed Recent_admix.bed Remnants_admix.bed"
for file in $files; do
    mywget https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~madjl/finestructure/badmixture/$file
done

## Get the scripts to process the data
git clone https://github.com/danjlawson/badMIXTUREexample.git
## Note that this stage requires git. You technically don't need it; you can download the scripts manually if you would prefer.  put them in a folder called "badMIXTUREexample" under your working directory for all the paths to work correctly.
